<h5>Hello! My name is S'Nya Sanchez. A little bit about me...</h5>

<p>I was born and grew up in Minneapolis, MN. I moved to ND in 2016 and have been missing the cities since! I have 2 dogs, one is a pitbull and the other is a<br> 
german shephard. I graduated High School in 2020 and went straight into college. I was unsure of what I wanted to go into. I knew the science program ha a lot of<br>
hands on activites and fun labs, but I also was interested in the classes the business class had to offer. I decided to do both! I am graduating with my associates<br>
at the end of this academic year (2023) and should be graduating with my asscoiates in business by the end of the next academic fall semester. My goal is to move by<br>
the end of 2023, and I am not sure where I want to go but I know it has to be somewhere warm. I cant do North Dakota's winter anymore!</p>

<p>I am very excited to see what this intertnship has to offer! I feel that I am going to enjoy it and learn a lot judging by this first assignment. I am already<br>
having fun learning how to create my own websitse and using codes to be creative with the format of the website. If this is how the assignments look, I am most<br>
definitely going to have fun and learn a lot.</p>
<p>I dont have any questions at the moment. I am sure once I am learning and trying to understand concepts, I will develop more questions!</p>
